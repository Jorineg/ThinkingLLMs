Analyze the premise:\\n   - 50% of British party members are female\\n   - Only 9.2% of women are represented in parliament\\n\\n2. Compare the percentages:\\n   - 50% party membership vs. 9.2% parliamentary representation\\n   - This shows a significant disparity\\n\\n3. Evaluate the hypothesis:\\n   - It states that women are poorly represented in parliament\\n   - The low percentage (9.2%) supports this claim\\n\\n4. Consider the context:\\n   - The premise provides data specifically about British parliament\\n   - The hypothesis doesn't specify a country, but aligns with the given information\\n\\n5. Conclusion:\\n   The premise supports the hypothesis, as the data shows a clear underrepresentation of women in parliament compared to their party membership.\\n\\n   \n",
